# MRI-Brain-Tumor-Classifier
This project implements a deep learning-based image classification system to identify and classify different types of brain tumors from MRI scans. The model is trained to distinguish between multiple tumor classes (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary), using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.
